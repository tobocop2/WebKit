// Drop after drop of code that a persistent bytecode cache hands back: every function is called between the drops, so no
// executable stays behind naming the payload's Decoder and each drop has to come by one; functions are constructed as
// well as called after every drop (the code block for construct is the second one an executable names); one round keeps
// the code in use; children of dropped code are remembered while they live and forgotten when they have died. The test
// ends right after a drop, so that with --destroy-vm the VM is torn down with children remembered.
