// Records of several module loaders share one ModuleProgramExecutable, its function declarations' executables and with
// them their optimized code, while each record has its own environment. The optimizing tiers treat the scope of a symbol
// table that has only ever seen one environment as a constant, so everything that can run this code has to have an
// environment made from the executable's one symbol table: the second environment then invalidates the inference. That
// has to hold when the executable's code was deleted and generated again in between, and for a record that reads its
// function declarations long after it made its environment (useLazyModuleFunctionDeclarations).
// (stress/module-loaders-share-released-code.js has the cases where the code is deleted after a loader has finished and
// while one is suspended in the module's body.)
