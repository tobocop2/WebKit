namespace JSC {

class BytecodeGenerator;

// A whole-function bytecode optimizer that runs at the end of bytecode generation (before
// generatorification and finalization). It decodes the generated instruction stream into a small IR,
// runs analyses (CFG, liveness) and transformations on it, and then re-emits a fresh instruction
// stream together with the side tables that reference instruction offsets (jump tables, exception
// handlers, expression info). Metadata IDs and value profile indices are renumbered densely.
//
// It runs when bytecode is generated with OptimizeBytecode::Yes (what an embedder passes to recursivelyGenerate* when
// building a bytecode cache image, e.g. bun build --compile --bytecode) or, for testing in the shell, when
// Options::useBytecodeOptimizer() is set.
